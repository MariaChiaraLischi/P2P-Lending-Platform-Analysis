# Quantitative-Finance

This project was completed as part of the coursework for the course Introduction to Quantitative Finance during the exchange at BI Norwegian Business School as part of the Bachelorâ€™s degree program in Management and Computer Science at Luiss Guido Carli University.

The work is focused on analyzing a P2P lending platform. Using a dataset of loan characteristics, we examined loan properties, borrower default risk, and payment flows. Tasks included evaluating yearly loan payments, modeling default probabilities, and assessing the impact of borrower credit ratings on interest rates. The analysis combined statistical modeling in R with financial theory to explore risk, payment variability, and internal rating effectiveness for investment decision-making.
